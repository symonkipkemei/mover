<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">mover </h1>

## brief
- A mover of the readme tab


## Task:
    ```
     Write a script that searches a folder you specify (as well as its subfolders, up to two levels deep) and compiles a list of all .jpg files contained in there. The list should include the complete path of each .jpg file.

     You should train:

     Using for loops
     Using conditional statements
     Working with pathlib
     Thinking about nested loops
     If you are feeling bold, create a list containing each type of file extension you find in the folder.

     Start with a small folder to make it easy to check whether your program is working correctly. Then search a bigger folder.

     This program should work for any specified folder on your computer.
